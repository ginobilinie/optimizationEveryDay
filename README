1. optimizationEveryDay.pdf introduce some basic knowledge for optimizaiton, will update ...
2. projectDoc_dongnie.pdf and projSlides.pdf introduces a first-oder primal dual algorithm which are fit for F+G, where F and G are both convex. It is especially suitable for non-smooth convex problems. The code will be updated later.
3. mlp-inference.pdf wants to introduce fp and bp for multi-layer-perceptron: fp时，明显的activation是forward propagation上去的；bp时，是sensitivity("error") back propogation下来的.
4. runExp.m and proxGD.m is for proximal gradient descent for a L1 regularization problem.
